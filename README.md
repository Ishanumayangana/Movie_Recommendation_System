ðŸ“„ Read Me: Basic Recommendation System

Project Overview

This project is a Basic Recommendation System built using machine learning algorithms. It leverages a Kaggle dataset to create personalized recommendations based on user preferences and behavior. The system can be adapted to recommend products, movies, or any other domain-specific content.

Key Features

Data Source: The project uses a publicly available dataset from Kaggle.

Algorithms: Implemented popular recommendation algorithms like collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.

Libraries & Tools:
Python (Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn)
Data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Machine Learning Models (KNN, Matrix Factorization)

Evaluation: The model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Precision-Recall to assess recommendation quality.

How It Works

Data Preprocessing: Cleans the dataset and handles missing values, transforming it into a usable format for model training.
Model Training: Trained on user-item interactions to predict recommendations using collaborative and content-based filtering methods.
Recommendation Generation: Once trained, the system suggests items based on a userâ€™s historical preferences and item features.

Future Improvements

Integrating more advanced algorithms like Deep Learning for better prediction accuracy.
Expanding the dataset to include more diverse interactions for improved recommendations.
